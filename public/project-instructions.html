        This is the first release of Event Horizon, an event planning and finding platform. There are two types of users, followers and posters. To register, simply click the register button from the landing page and enter your information. At this point, you can either choose to register as a poster, or not. If not you can register later from your account page.
        <br><br>
        Your home page is where you will be redirected upon login (unless you have logged in from another page on the site in which case you will be redirected there). In your home page, you will see your followed events. If you are a poster your "organizations" will be there. There is a button for mail and your account at the bottom right. Mail will be explained after.
        <br><br>
        If you wish to post an event, you must first create an organization to post through. Only a name is required. The location field will use google's api to provide results. A person who does not own your organization can message you through the organization page, and you can reply from your mail page accessible from the home page, at which point communication will occur there. You can also rate the organization at the bottom of the page and see reviews. Review posters and organization owners can delete their reviews.
        <br><br>
        Once you have an organization you can edit it or create new events with the top right buttons. The account and home page can be reach from the bottom buttons.
        <br><br>
        When creating a new event, you must have a name,*valid* date, and location. Location information will be autocompleted with the google maps api. This information will be used to place you on the search map and to show your location on the event page itself.
        <br><br>
        After creating the event, you can edit it with the button in the top right corner. In the edit form, you can submit local photos for your event.
        <br><br>
        From the event page, you can view the event's location on the map, and "attend" the event. Attending the event will place the event on your home page.
        <br><br>
        From the search page, which you can reach from the landing or home page, you can search for events by either location or name. Simply having the event occur in the boundaries of the map will make it show up, and you can move the map either by hand or with the search bar. If you check the name search, making an empty search will show all events, and making a search with terms separated by spaces will show any events that match any of those terms.
        <br><br>
        You can login from any page with the login button at the bottom right.
        <br><br>
        You can also login with google plus, which will prepopulate your email, first and last name.
        <br><br>
        The landing page can be reached by pressing the back button from the home page.
